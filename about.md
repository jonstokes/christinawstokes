## About me
You already have inside yourself all the resources you need to live your best life; for this reason I approach therapy as a collaborative process of activating those internal resources and of reintegrating those parts of yourself that trauma, illness, and loss have broken away and hidden out of your reach. You don't need to become someone else in order to move forward with your life, you just need to find your way back home.

I draw on a variety of tools to help guide you through the process of recovery from addiction, trauma, loss, and disordered eating. The modalities that I specialize in and find most effective are EMDR, CBT, DBT and Intuitive Eating.

Clients coming to me to find peace with food and with their body will find that we can address some of the root causes of their disordered eating with EMDR. I combine this technique with Intuitive Eating* while using a Health at Every Size (HAES) lens. [Click here](https://www.sizediversityandhealth.org/) to learn more aobut HAES.

Note:  I am currently completing certification in Intuitive Eating. Intuitive Eating is not a diet or an approach for weight loss.
